### Hi there ðŸ‘‹!

A personality is more than just a set of letters, but read about [INTJ-A](https://personalityjunkie.com/05/intj-t-vs-intj-a-personality-type/) is a good start.

My strengths :muscle::
- High expectations :star:
- Enjoys theoretical and abstract concepts
- Good at listening
- Takes criticism well
- Self-confident and hard-working

... and weaknesses :crying_cat_face::
- Can be overly analytical and judgmental :warning:
- Very perfectionistic :trophy:
- Dislikes talking about emotions
- Sometimes seems callous or insensitive
